# bin/size-threshold.sh <project> [lines|files|src|all] [tier] — how big is "too big" here?
#
# THE HOTFIX TIER (the operator, 2026-10-07: hotfix tickets build as one PR, not split).
# The tier is the 3rd argument or SIZE_TIER in the environment; bin/lib/rb/plan.sh
# passes SIZE_TIER=hotfix when the build's settled HOTFIX is 1. With it, each axis
# reads `size_gate.<axis>.hotfix.<project>` then `size_gate.<axis>.hotfix`
# (seeded 1500/30 in worker/jobs/schema.sql) BEFORE everything below, and the
# src says `row:hotfix`. A tier row that is missing or junk falls through to the
# normal chain, exactly as a junk normal row does. Any other tier value, or none,
# is no tier: the answer is byte-for-byte what it was before the tier existed.
#
# Resolution, PER AXIS, first hit wins (BH-4985, the operator 2026-10-06: "that should
# be a database setting, not hard coded"):
#   1. settings row `size_gate.<axis>.<project>` (axis = lines|files, project
#      lowercased) — one project's own limit.
#   2. settings row `size_gate.<axis>` — the fleet limit. worker/jobs/schema.sql
#      seeds both fleet rows at 700/20 (insert only when missing), and /config
#      edits them with the change audited in config_changes. Rows are read from
#      state/settings-cache.json through bin/lib/lane-gate.sh, the TTL cache
#      every lane shares (one GET per 60 s per box, not one per build).
#   3. a box-local override in flags/size-gate-<project>, one line
#      "<lines> [files]". The emergency lever for a box with no worker.
#   4. catalog/size-thresholds.conf, a repo-tracked line "<project> <lines>
#      <files>", reaching every box on its own harness-sync.
#   5. 700 lines / 20 files — the documented fallback, and the only hardcode.
# The worker down, no cache, an unreadable cache or LANE_GATE_DISABLE=1 all mean
# no rows: 3-5 answer exactly as before rows existed. Never 0, never "no gate".
# `src` prints where the answer came from: row:hotfix|row|flag|catalog|default when both
# axes agree, else `lines:<a>,files:<b>`. `all` prints "<lines> <files> <src>".
#
# WHY 700 AND 20 (the operator, 2026-10-06). Measured on our own split-vs-whole builds:
# in the 300-600 line band a split cost $44.8 / 10.4h against $27.6 / 5.9h built
# whole, and in 600-1000 $60.7 / 21.7h against $22.6 / 12.0h. The review-block
# rate by file count runs 12/19/22/33%, so files stay a separate axis. 139 of
# 371 split families stranded spend, $12.9K of $28.3K. Shipped/declared median
# is 1.29, so 700 declared trips at about 805 (the 15% band), which is roughly
# 1,000 shipped lines. Above about 1,000 shipped lines 60% of builds needed a
# fix round, so splitting stays. LINES ARE PRODUCT LINES — tests, docs, specs,
# lockfiles and generated files do not count; bin/size-scope.sh owns that list
# and is the only place it lives.
# Before 2026-10-06: 300/12 (2026-09-12, borrowed from the 100-300 range large orgs land).
#
# A partial flag is a partial override: "150" on its own changes the line limit
# and leaves the file limit wherever the catalog (or the default) had it.
# Resetting the other half to the default would be a silent second edit nobody
# asked for.
#
# Junk is never a threshold. A word, a negative or a 0 — in a row, a flag or the
# catalog — falls through to the next source: a threshold of 0 would split every
# ticket ever filed, and a threshold of "banana" would disable the gate while
# looking configured.
