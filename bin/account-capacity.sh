# bin/account-capacity.sh [vendor] — how many heavy sessions of a vendor this
# fleet can actually run at once, and why.
#
#   usage:  account-capacity.sh [claude|codex|grok|openrouter|fireworks]
#   stdout: "<n> (<why>)"  or  "unlimited (<why>)"
#
# THE CEILING NOBODY WROTE DOWN. Every other cap in the build path is about
# machines — pool machines, box slots, wip limits — and none of them is the one
# that actually stalls. docs/LESSONS.md #6: "MODEL CAPACITY IS THE THROUGHPUT
# CEILING, NOT HARDWARE. 2-core boxes build fine; every stall was account
# weather (session caps, org spend caps, 429s). Parallel lanes multiply burn
# against one account (~3-4 heavy sessions max)."
#
# That matters most exactly where it is least visible: bin/fly-envbundle.sh
# builds the bundle with ONE CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, and until 2026-09-14 every
# machine in a project's Fly pool got that same one — so a pool cap of 20 was 20
# sessions on one account, not 20 accounts.
#
# SINCE 2026-09-14 THAT IS CONDITIONAL, so the count is too. bin/lib/pool-account.sh
# leases a per-machine account at launch, and the accounts it can lease are the
# ones with a SHIPPABLE token in env/tokens.d — a login-only registry entry
# (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, no tokens.d file) can pay for a call on the box itself but
# cannot be handed to a Fly machine. So when that directory exists and holds at
# least one token, the claude count below is the accounts that can actually ship
# (plus `default`, which is what an unarmed or saturated launch still uses); with
# no env/tokens.d — every box except the hub — the count is exactly what it was.
#
# DATA FIRST, CONSTANT LAST, and it says which it used:
#   1. state/quota/<account>.json (bin/quota-poll.sh) — accounts of this vendor
#      that are enabled, not cooling down, and not already at 100%.
#   2. env/accounts.d/*.env — the registry, when no quota has been polled yet.
#   3. the implicit `default` account alone, which is what every non-routed call
#      on a box already uses (docs/ACCOUNT-ROUTING.md; ACCOUNT_ROUTING defaults
#      off, and an unrouted fleet has exactly one account).
# multiplied by fly/account-capacity.conf's per-account number, else 4.
#
# Read-only: never calls out, never reads a credential, never prints a label
# that is not already in the registry. Always exits 0 — a planner that cannot
# read this must fall back to its own judgement, never to a stack trace (the
# bin/free-slots.sh contract).
