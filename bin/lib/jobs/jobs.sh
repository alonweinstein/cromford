# bin/lib/jobs/jobs.sh — BH-1194: the job row itself: claims and the double-build guard, the lane lifecycle, phases, heartbeats, rules and retry policy, artifacts, transcripts, verdicts, contracts, caps and the catalog, plus the hub ledgers of record. Sourced by bin/jobs-client.sh (JC_MODULES), never run.

# job_open <project> <ticket_id> <kind> <stage> [lane] [meta-json] [issue_created_at]
#   issue_created_at (BH-482.0): ISO stamp of the GitHub issue; passed through
#           untouched, the worker validates; empty = absent from the body.
#   rc 0 -> prints the job id (claim is ours; the row carries the resolved cap)
#   rc 9 -> REFUSED. Work this box may not start right now. Two shapes, both of
#           them a CLEAN SKIP for the caller and never an error:
#             "IN_FLIGHT <box> <job-id>"  — the phase-1 double-build guard
#             "REFUSED <scope> :: <reason>" — a phase-6 concurrency rule, or a
#             retry of this same work already scheduled with a backoff still to
#             run. The reason is the row's own words, so a log line can say WHY
#             without a second round trip.
#           JOB_REFUSED carries the same reason for callers that do not capture
#           stdout. The CALLER decides; the documented default is skip and log.
#   rc 1 -> API unusable. Say nothing, behave exactly like today.

#   machine used to hand its terminal facts to the HUB, which handed them to the
#   owning box, which staged them for a session that read them back out of a
#   text file. Every one of those hops is a clock, and the hub is in the middle
#   of all of them. This is the same facts — result line, pr_url, sha, tier,
#   verdict, cost — written straight to the row the builder already holds, the
#   moment the build concludes. bin/lib/builder-direct.sh:bd_facts composes the
#   object, so what goes into the ledger and what the builder acts on cannot
#   come to disagree.

# Every enrolled lane does the same four things — claim, heartbeat, spend,

# run-build.sh, run-triage.sh and bin/orc-job.sh each grew their own copy, and
# by the third the copies had already drifted: one exported JOB_ID (so
# agent-call.sh could attribute spend to the row) and one did not; one beat
# immediately and one waited a full 150s interval for its first beat, which is
# the difference between a run killed in its first two minutes being judgeable
# and being a row that never beat. Phase 4 enrolls another six callers, so the
# lifecycle becomes ONE pair of functions here rather than six more
# transcriptions of it.
#
# Fail-open exactly like everything else in this file: with the worker
# unreachable job_lane_open leaves JOB_ID empty, job_lane_close is a no-op, and
# the caller runs precisely as it does today.

# waits: there is exactly one claim per job and these are child records of it.
# A phase that could block a stage would turn one decision point into three, and
# a network blip between plan and execute would strand a build that is already
# paid for. Every helper here is fail-open like the rest of this file — with the

#   attempt opens a newer build row, and that un-finalizes the ticket. Only a
#   build row: triage-shard, lead-review, orc-job and migration-autopilot open
#   rows under the same ticket key, and a newer one of those is not an attempt
#   (review of #2481), so it must not un-abandon the ticket.
#   rc 0 -> the newest build row is `abandoned`; prints its job id
#   rc 1 -> it is not (another status, no row at all, or an answer for a
#           different ticket or kind: a worker older than the ticket_id / kind
#           filters answers a newer row, and that must never read as a match)

#           this box has no cached ABANDON for the key (BH-2505); callers fall
#           back to today's behaviour.
#   THE ABANDON SURVIVES AN OUTAGE ON THE BOX THAT SAW IT (BH-2505). Each good
#   read refreshes $JOBS_HARNESS/state/abandoned-tickets/<project>/<key>, one
#   file holding the job id: an abandoned answer writes it, an empty answer or a
#   newest build row for this ticket in any other status deletes it, and an
#   answer about another ticket or kind leaves it alone. When the worker then
#   fails to answer, a cached key answers rc 0 with that job id. No JOBS_HARNESS

# job_verdict_rebind <pr-url> <sha>

#   produced — the rebase train's verified rebase, the merge queue's own rebase.
#   Those rebases carry the tree a reviewer already read onto a newer base; they
#   are not fix commits nobody saw. Without a rebind every PR either mover
#   touches would fail the head-bound check on the next sweep tick and need a
#   hand merge, which is the starvation class the train exists to kill.
#
#   REBINDS, NEVER CLAIMS. rc 2 when the row carries no reviewed_sha: a build
#   from before item 1 shipped makes no claim about its head, and inventing one
#   here would turn "the old behaviour" into a gate the fleet never opted into.
#   Only a row that ALREADY names a reviewed sha can have it moved.
#
#   The rest of the verdict detail (tier, provenance, record, note) is read back
#   and rewritten verbatim — the artifact upserts on (job_id, artifact_kind), so
#   a put that dropped those fields would silently erase the merge sweep's tier
#   and provenance inputs.

# --- BH-1024: the ledger as the FIRST home of the verdict and the reviewed sha -
# Today the same two facts live in four places — this artifact, a build record's
# `reviewed-sha` file, the `apverdict` lines in the conductor's attempts.txt and
# `.sha` in state/<project>.pr-reviews.json. The three files are on ONE box, so
# a lane elsewhere cannot see them, and a stale one costs either a second paid
# review or a parked PR. These readers let a lane ask the ledger FIRST. They are
# inert until an operator flips the flag row, and the files stay exactly where
# they are as the write-through cache and the fallback.

# verdict_single_home_on — rc 0 when the ledger is the first reader.
#   Resolution order is the gh-budget pattern (bin/lib/gh-budget.sh:72-88):
#   settings('verdict_single_home') first, then $VERDICT_SINGLE_HOME as the
#   documented env fallback, then the literal 0. THE DEFAULT IS OFF, and off is
#   today's behaviour byte for byte, which is what makes this landable dark.
#
#   MEMOISED PER PROCESS (the job_for_record rule): a tick that asks per PR must
#   not buy a settings read per PR. AN OUTAGE IS NEVER CACHED — a worker that
#   blinks for one tick must not pin three lanes onto one answer for the rest of
#   the process. An outage reads the SAME env fallback a missing row does (0 on
#   every box that has not set VERDICT_SINGLE_HOME), which is the honest
#   description of this code: it is not a rule that an unreachable worker always
#   reads OFF. A box that sets the env to 1 and loses the worker reads ON and
#   every ledger call under it then returns rc 1, which every caller treats as
#   "buy the read" — the same answer it gives today.

# job_verdict_covers <pr-url> <sha> [source] [word]
#   Is there ALREADY a settled verdict bound to exactly this head — and, when a
#   source or a verdict word is named, written by that lane / saying that word?
#   One GET, and the question every file-based dedupe in this fleet was really
#   asking.
#     rc 0 -> covered: a settled row whose reviewed_sha IS this sha
#     rc 2 -> a REAL no: no row, no verdict, a provisional one, a different sha,

#     rc 1 -> outage, or a missing argument
#
#   THE WORD FILTER IS NOT DECORATION. "Covered" and "approved" are different
#   facts: a caller that skips work on a BLOCK bound to this head has skipped it
#   on a reviewer saying NO. mc_ap_consumed asks for APPROVE for exactly that
#   reason; a caller that wants either word simply leaves it empty.
#
#   SILENCE IS NEVER "COVERED". Every caller treats rc != 0 as "buy the read",
#   which is byte-identical to what it does today, so an outage can only cost a
#   review that would have been bought anyway — never a skipped one.
#
#   EXACT STRING EQUALITY on the sha, deliberately: an abbreviated head or a
