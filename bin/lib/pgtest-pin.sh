# bin/lib/pgtest-pin.sh — the throwaway Postgres the pool image bakes (BH-5962).
# Sourced, never executed; sourcing it only sets the pins.
#
# fly/Dockerfile's bake-pgtest block holds the same three literals (the build
# context is fly/ and cannot read this file), and
# tests/pool-test-postgres.bh-5962-test.sh (P8) fails when they differ.
# bin/lib/pg-test.sh's PGT_BIN_DIR default is "$PGTEST_PIN_DIR/bin" (P8 too).
# Major 16 is the major the project-6-os suite runs on: its CI, and the
# embedded Postgres 16 the TK-3 build started. A second major is a second pin.
#
# They are assigned, not defaulted, so no environment variable can move the pin.
