# bin/lib/builder-direct.sh — the shared vocabulary of "the builder finishes its
# own job" (W2-B, the operator 2026-09-14: "4000 builder boxes submitting PRs all day;
# every throughput ceiling is a bug").
#
# THE FUNNEL THIS EXISTS TO REMOVE. A pool machine's build result came back to
# the HUB (bin/fly-results-ingest.sh -> state/remote-results/<p>/KEY.json), sat
# there until the owning box's next triage tick staged it, sat again until that
# session read the RESULT and posted the board comment, and only then did a
# 5-minute merge-conductor tick look at the PR. Three clocks and two machines
# stand between a finished build and a client hearing about it, and the hub is
# in the middle of every hop — at 4000 builders that is both the bottleneck and
# the single point of failure. The "remote-result unconsumed >30m" alerts in
# bin/pipeline-health.sh are that funnel backing up, seen from the side.
#
# The machine that built the thing already has the project env, the board token
# and the finished record. So it does the close-out itself: posts the board
# comment, moves the status, writes the terminal result straight to the jobs
# ledger, and rings the doorbell. The hub's ingest becomes bookkeeping.
#
# THE MARKER IS THE HAND-OFF, and it lives here so there is ONE definition of
# it. A close-out that has been posted must be visible to every OTHER path that
# could post a second one — the relay json, the ledger artifact feed, the hub's
# ingest — and the only thing all three spell identically is the FIRST LINE of
# the RESULT file (bin/run-triage.sh's own cross-path identity comment says the
# same thing, for the same reason). So a posted close-out appends a note there,
# and every reader asks bd_closed_out rather than growing its own grep.
#
# KILL FLAG: BUILDER_DIRECT=0 in the environment or env/global.env, or the
# builder-direct-off switch (BH-2435: the settings row
# switch.builder-direct-off[.<box>], then flags/builder-direct-off). Either one
# makes builder_direct_on answer 0, every
# caller skips its new path, nothing is appended to any RESULT line, and the
# relay path is byte for byte what it is today.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Safe under `set -u`. Nothing here logs, alerts, posts
# or writes: every function answers a question and the CALLER decides what that
# means.

# bd_result_in_ledger <project> <key> <result-line> [machine-build-dir]
#   -> THREE ANSWERS, because
#   "the ledger says no" and "the ledger could not be asked" are different facts
#   with different remedies (BH-1041):
#
#     rc 0  the feed carries THIS BUILD's terminal result. The hub has nothing
#           to relay.
#     rc 1  the feed was READ and does not carry it. Relay, exactly as this hub
#           always has.
#     rc 2  it could not be ASKED at all: no jobs client in this shell, a
#           transport or HTTP failure, or an empty project/key.
#
#   WHICH BUILD, NOT WHICH TICKET (BH-1041 round-1 fix). Pass the machine build
#   dir — `basename $BUILD` on the builder, which is what bin/run-build.sh names
#   its row's detail.build_dir and what fly/builder-runner.sh writes as the
#   RESULT's `BUILD_DIR:` line — and the match is that build's own row. Without
#   it the only identity available is the ticket key, and a SECOND build of the
#   same key (a fix round, a re-dispatch) whose machine could not write its own
#   row reads as delivered on the FIRST build's row: rc 0, no relay, and the
#   ticket never hears the second result. With it that case is rc 1 and relays.
#
#   The key match survives as the FALLBACK, and only for a row that carries no
#   build_dir at all — rows written before 2026-09-10, which have no way to say
#   which build they are. A caller with no build dir in hand (there is no
#   BUILD_DIR: line on an older builder's RESULT) gets exactly today's
#   key-or-line match, so nothing regresses on the way in.
#
#   Reads back rather than assuming, exactly as bin/fly-pool.sh's reap does: the
#   artifact is written by run-build.sh ON THE MACHINE, so "the row is there" is
#   something the hub can only learn by asking.
#
#   WHY rc 2 EXISTS. Until BH-1041 rc 1 covered both of the last two and every
#   caller relayed on it, so a blink of the coordination DB pushed a copy of a
#   result whose row was already travelling — and the owning box staged the
#   build twice, which is two close-out comments on one client's ticket. Unknown
#   is not "absent", and a caller that cannot tell them apart has to guess.
#   What to DO about rc 2 is the caller's: bin/fly-results-ingest.sh leaves the
#   result on its builder for the next sweep, bin/fly-pool.sh parks it under a
#   RELAY_DEFERRED marker and re-asks each tick. Neither may map rc 2 to
#   "delivered" OR to "absent".
