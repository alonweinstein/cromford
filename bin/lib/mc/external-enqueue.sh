# bin/lib/mc/external-enqueue.sh — BH-4580 (BH-4572.1): an approved, green,
# clean PR from an EXTERNAL author on a Mergify repo asks Mergify to queue it.
# Sourced by bin/merge-conductor.sh, never run.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. On 2026-10-05 project-4 had 19 PRs from its engineer, each one
# APPROVED by bin/review-prs.sh on its current head and mergeable_state clean,
# none merged. review-prs hands every Mergify-repo APPROVE to the conductor
# (mc_queue_conductor_only), but the conductor lists only HARNESS_PR_AUTHORS'
# PRs (harness_pr_list, mc_is_harness_pr), so nothing consumed the hand-off.
# Those two stay as they are: every lane reads them. This is a second,
# additive enumeration.
#
# xe_project <project> <slug> <provider> <pbase>
#   Called right after ae_project, once per project per conductor tick. ONE REST
#   page of open PRs; each row whose author is NOT harness_pr_author_match goes
#   through bin/lib/autoenqueue.sh's _ae_offer with AE_EXTERNAL=1: the same
#   gates (G1 draft/base/queued/hold labels, G2 per-head ledger, G3 review-prs'
#   APPROVE bound to this head or a standing MERGE, G4 checks, G5 clean, G7
#   fences and main-red freeze and block gate, G6 kill switches), with the
#   iron-law scan (IL) in place of the conductor's READY mark, the same
#   per-tick MC_AUTOENQUEUE_CAP (AE_POSTED carries over from ae_project) and the
#   same write -> send -> confirm `@mergifyio queue`. No tier is read here.
#   A list read answering 75 is rate limited or unreachable: the tick is
#   skipped, never read as "no PRs" (#768).
#
# It never merges and never labels. Its only write is _ae_send's comment.
# gh-rest: no-graphql
