# bin/lib/builds-of-record.sh — THE BUILDS OF RECORD, READ FROM THE LEDGER
# (BH-2347, slice 1 of BH-2312). Sourced, never executed; defines functions only.
#
# Four lanes used to learn "which builds did this project record" by scanning
# builds/*/RESULT on one box. The binding (result, pr_url) is already written to
# the jobs ledger; this is its read side. The caller sources bin/jobs-client.sh
# first (as bin/merge-sweep.sh does). Without job_artifact_feed every call is rc 1.
#
# bor_list <project> [since] [limit]
#   Two feed calls (kind result, kind pr_url) joined on job_id in one awk pass.
#   TSV: key, build_dir, box, updated_at, result_line, pr_url (or -), job_id.
#   key and build_dir come from the result row's detail JSON; build_dir loses the
#   hub's pool-/fly- copy prefix (as job_for_record does) and only its newest row
#   is kept. A result row with no build_dir cannot be keyed and is skipped.
#   rc 0 rows printed, rc 2 the worker answered with none, rc 1 outage on EITHER
#   feed or no client: NOTHING is printed, since a half join reads as "no PR".
#   limit: arg, else BOR_LIMIT (the lib knob lib.builds-of-record.bor_limit,
#   applied when the caller has sourced bin/lib/lane-gate.sh), else 500.
#   A feed that returns `limit` rows was cut off: BOR_TRUNCATED=1 goes to stderr
#   AND is exported. The export only reaches a caller that calls bor_list
#   directly, not inside $(...), which is why the stderr line exists.
#   Refs stay exactly as jq @tsv wrote them: an escaped \t or \n in a ref is two
#   literal characters here and never an extra column or row.
#
# bor_local_dir <build_dir>
#   The on-disk dir under $H/builds for a ledger build_dir: the exact name, then
#   pool-<name>, then fly-<name>. rc 2 and nothing printed when none exists.
#
# bor_union <project>
#   bor_list's rows, then one row per local <project>-<KEY>-*/RESULT (bare, pool-
#   or fly- copy) the ledger does not name: box, pr_url and job_id are `-`,
#   updated_at is the RESULT mtime, result_line its first line (tabs made spaces).
#   A record in both appears once, with the ledger's row. The rest of the dir
#   name must start with a ticket key, so project `project-4` never takes in
#   `project-4-TK-1-1`. rc 1 from bor_list is rc 1 here with nothing printed, so a
#   caller keeps its file path on an outage. bor_list runs in a subshell here:
#   its BOR_TRUNCATED stderr line passes through, the export does not.
