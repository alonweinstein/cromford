# bin/lib/hold-push.sh — THE ONE WAY A LANE PUSHES TO A PR BRANCH (BH-2504).
# Sourced, never executed: no `set -e`, no `exit`, no output at source time.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (2026-09-25). A lead put six tickets on HOLD to fix their PRs by
# hand, and six lanes pushed onto those branches anyway:
#   - bin/blocked-resolver.sh's fix round on #2481, 29 s after the HOLD (it read
#     the hold when its run started and never again), and on #2476 18 minutes
#     after it (the `review-changes-requested` rung never read the ticket);
#   - main-merge pushes on #2493, #2552 and #2586;
#   - a rebuild push on #2592, and a harness push on #2593.
# Every one of them had a lead fix agent working the same branch. That is two
# writers on one branch (#2182), and the lead lost the race each time.
#
# THE RULE, which tests/hold-push-ratchet.bh-2504-test.sh keeps true: a lane
# that writes a PR branch pushes through hold_push, and hold_push
#   1. reads the TICKET's hold (bin/lib/hold.sh: the line-anchored HOLD/RESUME
#      thread, the title, the body, and the `hold` label) IMMEDIATELY before
#      the push, never from a read taken when the round started;
#   2. pushes with `--force-with-lease=<branch>:<the sha the round started
#      from>`, so a lead commit that landed mid-round makes git refuse the push
#      instead of the lane overwriting it. There is no plain `-f` here at all.
# A refusal writes ONE line and pushes nothing; the caller throws its local
# round away, which every caller already does on a failed push.
#
# WHICH TICKET. The ticket a PR branch belongs to is a GitHub ISSUE only on the
# issues lanes (fleet.conf board_prefix "-"). On an in-app board the ticket
# lives on the board and there is no issue to read (fly-pool's 2026-09-21
# lesson: reading one froze every board project's pool), so the lease is the
# whole guard there. The caller names the issue when it knows it; otherwise it
# comes from the branch (`ticket/bh-2406-r2` -> 2406), the same parse
# mc_ticket_of_branch uses.
#
# UNREADABLE IS NOT CLEAR. A hold read that failed says nothing about whether a
# person just typed HOLD, so it pushes nothing (rc 4) and the lane retries on
# its next tick — the answer hold.sh gives everywhere else.
#
# NEVER REWRITE A PARENT UNDER ITS CHILDREN (BH-5234). #5010 was force-pushed
# while #5053 was stacked on it, and #5053 then carried the parent's OLD commits
# beside the landed ones. So a REWRITE push (the lease is not an ancestor of
# what is pushed) to a branch that open PRs are based on is refused (rc 5, one
# line naming them): merge instead, or let the conductor restack them. Only a
# rewrite reads the children (bin/lib/stale-parent.sh sp_open_children), and an
# unreadable list refuses it too (rc 4). mc_restack, the one sanctioned rewriter
# of a parent, passes HOLD_PUSH_CHILDREN=follow because it follows them itself.
# HOLD_PUSH_REWRITE_GUARD=0 (catalog/lanes.d/_lib.stale-parent.json) is the
# pre-BH-5234 push. No stale-parent lib beside this file: the guard is skipped,
# said once per process.
