#!/bin/bash
# bin/lane-reaper.sh — every-box cron (*/10): kill a run-build.sh lane that is
# still ALIVE long past its deadline, or whose checkout has been deleted under
# it, and close the record it was holding.
#
# THE GAP (#643). Two BH-42 lanes ran for 21 hours out of a /tmp checkout that
# no longer existed. Nothing on the box had the job: bin/resume-dead-builds.sh
# only looks at builds whose process is GONE (a free key lock on a quiet dir),
# and bin/jobs-watchdog.sh judges LEDGER ROWS and executes nothing. A lane that
# is alive and useless sits between the two, holding its claim, its key lock and
# its build slot, until a human notices. This is the third lane: alive, late,
# and killed.
#
# THE ORDER IS THE CONTRACT, and it is this way round for one reason:
# run-build.sh installs an EXIT trap (_job_finish) that runs on SIGTERM while
# it waits on a child, and that trap closes the ledger row against whatever
# $BUILD/RESULT says. So the verdict is written FIRST, before any signal — a
# RESULT written after the kill is a row closed against nothing.
#   1. RESULT  "ABANDONED_TIMEOUT <why>"   (only if absent — never overwrite)
#   2. SIGTERM the lane's process group, wait, then SIGKILL. A pid that
#      survives SIGKILL is logged and left: NOT marked, NOT announced, retried.
#   3. release the claim (state/claims/<project>/<KEY>)
#   4. close the ledger row (job_update status=failed), fail-open
#   5. touch REAPED — "the kill landed and the claim is gone"
#   6. exactly ONE bin/lane-alert.sh line, LAST, quoting the RESULT actually on
#      disk (a lane that concluded on its own inside the TERM grace keeps its
#      own verdict, and the alert says so).
# A crash between any two steps costs at most one missing alert: it never costs
# a second kill, a second alert, or a REAPED dir whose process is still running.
#
# FINISHING A REAP WE DID NOT FINISH. A dir with OUR verdict and no REAPED is a
# kill we started and did not confirm: a SIGKILL that landed after our poll gave
# up, or a tick that died (reboot) between steps 1 and 5. SIGKILL runs no EXIT
# trap and a reboot runs nothing, so nobody else releases that claim or closes
# that row. So when we re-enter such a dir and the process it named is gone (or
# its pid has been reused), the kill HAS landed and we run steps 3-6. Without
# that, "retried" above would only ever work while the lane still breathed, and
# a dead one sat forever, claim held, nobody told.
#
# WHO ACTS ON IT: the results sweep in prompts/*.md, on `ABANDONED_TIMEOUT` with
# a REAPED marker present. A verdict with no REAPED is a kill that has not
# landed yet — the next tick finishes it.
#
# THE DEADLINE IS PER LANE (BH-1770, the operator 2026-09-24). A run is late when it
# has lived longer than LANE_REAP_DEADLINE_SECS since job.json's started_at. The
# knob is registered on this lane (catalog/lanes.d/lane-reaper.json, default
# 16200 = the old flat 4h30m) and resolved PER BUILD LANE through lane_knob:
#   lane.lane-reaper.<project>.lane_reap_deadline_secs   that project's builds
#   lane.lane-reaper.lane_reap_deadline_secs             every other build
#   LANE_REAP_DEADLINE_SECS in the env                    then the registry default
# A row is clamped to the registry's min/max. An operator who had tuned the
# old pair keeps that total as the env tier: when LANE_EXPECTED_SECS +
# LANE_REAP_GRACE_SECS is not 16200 and the env names no deadline, the sum is
# exported as it (a settings row still beats it). A dir with no usable
# started_at (absent, or 0 — no build writes that) predates this and keeps the
# old rule, expected_by + LANE_REAP_GRACE_SECS.
#
# WHO RELAUNCHES A REAPED RUN: bin/blocked-resolver.sh, and only it
# (br_from_builds' `abandoned-timeout`, on its capped rebuild ladder; ABANDONED
# with one alert once that is spent). The sweep closes the dir out and never
# relaunches it. The alert below says so.
#
# KNOBS (env -> flags/scheduler.conf -> the default here, via bin/lib/scheduler-conf.sh):
#   LANE_REAP_GRACE_SECS  1800   how long past expected_by before we act (legacy
#                                dirs only, see above)
#   LANE_REAP_MAX         20     reaps per tick; over the cap a dir is DEFERRED
#                                (no marker, re-offered next tick), never dropped
#   LANE_REAP_KILL_WAIT_S 30     TERM->KILL wait. A signal-delivery seam, not a
#                                business knob: env only, lowered by the suite.
# Kill switch: flags/lane-reaper-off (or the `switch.lane-reaper-off` settings
# row; answered before the lock and before any
# write). Self-overlap: flock -n on locks/lane-reaper.lock — a tick that finds
# the lock held exits 0 and waits for nobody.
#
# HUB AND FLY: no-op by construction. Hub build dirs are ingested from other
# boxes, so their pids are either dead here or belong to some unrelated local
