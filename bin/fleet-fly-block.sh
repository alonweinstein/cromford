# Sources (all optional — a project with none of them is reported with empty
# arrays, never omitted): state/fly-pool/<project>/*.json is one file per live
# pool machine, state/fly/<project>.json is the persistent builder,
# flags/fly-pool-app-<project> names the dedicated pool app, and
# state/fly-pool/<project>/.sweep.json is what bin/fly-pool.sh's dead-machine
# sweep observed on its last tick.
#
# Every read is defensive on purpose. fly-pool.sh writes .<machine>.snapmt
# sidecars into the same directory and a machine file can be caught mid-write,
# so one unparseable file must never take the whole snapshot down — Mission
# Control going blank looks exactly like the fleet going dark.
