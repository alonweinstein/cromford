# bin/concurrency-apply.sh --dry-run|--apply [project] [--json]
#   — the recommended concurrency_rules repo/<p>/build for every pool project,
#     and (with --apply) the writes that get there.
#
# THE PROPOSAL, IN ONE LINE: a project may build as many at once as the smaller
# of the machines it can have and the ACCOUNT that pays for them.
#
#   proposed = min( bin/pool-cap.sh <p> , bin/account-capacity.sh <vendor> )
#
# WHY THE ACCOUNT HALF IS THE POINT. Every cap in the build path today counts
# machines, and machines were never the bottleneck: docs/LESSONS.md #6 — "MODEL
# CAPACITY IS THE THROUGHPUT CEILING, NOT HARDWARE. 2-core boxes build fine;
# every stall was account weather (session caps, org spend caps, 429s). Parallel
# lanes multiply burn against one account (~3-4 heavy sessions max)."
# bin/fly-envbundle.sh builds the bundle with ONE CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN — the
# owning box's — and until 2026-09-14 every machine in a project's pool got that
# same one, so a pool cap of 20 bought 20 heavy sessions on ONE account, not 20
# accounts' worth of headroom; the extra machines queued inside the vendor, where
# nothing in this fleet can see them. bin/lib/pool-account.sh now leases a
# per-machine account at launch where env/tokens.d has shippable tokens, so on
# THAT box the ceiling is (shippable accounts x sessions-per-account) and
# bin/account-capacity.sh counts it that way. Everywhere else the old sentence
# still holds exactly, which is why this half of the min() stays.
# Raising the pool cap and the rule in lockstep, as was done by hand on
# 2026-09-11 and again on 2026-09-12, keeps those two agreeing with each other
# and neither of them agreeing with the account.
#
# DB-DRIVEN, CODE FALLBACK. The account number comes from polled quota data,
# then the env/accounts.d registry, then the implicit single account — and the
# per-account session count from fly/account-capacity.conf, a reviewed line,
# with the documented LESSONS.md figure only as a last resort. Every path says
# which one it took.
#
# ONLY POOL PROJECTS ARE PROPOSED. On the local route the repo rule is not what
# binds — flags/build-slots and concurrency_rules box/*/build are — so raising a
# repo rule there would promise parallelism the box cannot deliver, and lowering
# it would change nothing visible. The plan says "no change" and why.
#
# NEVER RAW SQL. The rule is a row behind an API with a specificity ladder the
# worker owns; writing it any other way is how a cap comes to bind somewhere
# nobody meant. Every write goes through `bin/jobs-client.sh rule-set`.
#
# IDEMPOTENT. A project already at its proposed value is not written at all, so
# this is safe on a cron or in a loop and an unchanged run is silent.
