#!/bin/bash
# bin/state-backup.sh — the off-box copy of this box's harness state.
#
# WHY (#388, 2026-09-15). The hub's /root/harness/{env,bin,prompts,logs,builds}
# vanished under a running system with no off-box copy, so nothing came back.
# This lane is one tarball of what a box cannot reconstruct, uploaded to an
# S3-compatible bucket (R2). WHAT GOES IN: env/ encrypted with age (the ONLY way
# env/ leaves the box — the tarball is checked for plaintext env/ entries before
# any upload), state/ (minus state/scratch/, which is operator scratch a restore
# does not want back), logs/, flags/, the builds/ summaries, the orchestrator
# checkout minus node_modules/.git, meta/. HOW IT FAILS: ONE actionable
# ALERTS.log line naming the stage and the key NAMES, never a value, then exit
# 1; state/backup-last.json is written only after head-object confirms the
# remote size, so a stamp without a delivered backup is impossible. OFF:
# STATE_BACKUP=0, or the switch state-backup-off read through lane_switch
# (BH-2438): the settings row switch.state-backup-off[.<box>] when one exists,
# else flags/state-backup-off. DEDUPE: flock -n on
# locks/state-backup.lock — a held lock skips, it never waits (that is a queue).
# Rung: the uploader. Restore is #449 (docs/RESTORE.md), the merge side #446,
# the cron line #448.
#
# IDLE PRIORITY AND THE SKIP (BH-6173). On 2026-10-12 the hub ran at 44% steal
# and this lane's zstd took 69% of one CPU every 15 minutes, next to the merge
# conductor. So every heavy child runs under `nice -n 19 ionice -c3 -t`, the
# archive compresses with `zstd -<BACKUP_ZSTD_LEVEL> -T1` (default 1: 34% less
# CPU than the old default 3 for a 16% bigger object), and a run whose inputs
# match the manifest of the last shipped object ships nothing. A skip is not
# blind: it head-objects the last key at its recorded size first, and only then
# moves .ts in the stamp, so the freshness signal means "the off-box copy
# matches this box's inputs at ts". BACKUP_FORCE_HOURS (24) forces a real upload
# anyway; BACKUP_FORCE=1 (bin/box-ops.sh "back up now") always ships. The hub's
# logs/ and state/ change every minute, so there the skip almost never fires and
# the saving is the priority and the level.

# ── THIS BOX STATES ITS OWN BACKUP FRESHNESS (BH-1031) ───────────────────────
# The hub used to COLLECT this, by splicing bin/lib/backup-freshness.sh's probe
# into the 15-minute ssh hop bin/fleet-heartbeat.sh already made. That lane is
# deleted in state→DB slice 6 (it answered "can the hub reach the box", not "is
# the lane alive"), so the fact travels the other way now: the machine that owns
# it says so, and the hub reads every box's answer in one call.
#
# THIS SCRIPT IS THE RIGHT PLACE and the only one. It runs on every box the hop
# covered, on the same 15-minute cadence (5,20,35,50), and — decisively — it is
# the WRITER of the stamp. A reporter on its own cron would publish the previous
# run's timestamp: with a 15-minute backup rhythm and a 30-minute stale
# threshold, the reported age would sit at the threshold and flap. Reported from
# here, on the way out, the age is the one the stamp actually has.
#
# ON THE WAY OUT, ON EVERY PATH. The four states are not all reachable from one
# line: `off` exits at the kill switches, `unconfigured` exits at the key check,
# `missing` and `ok` fall out of the upload. An EXIT trap is what makes all four
# report — and a box that reports nothing at all is read by the hub as a box
# that went quiet, which for `off` would be a lie and for `unconfigured` a page
# nobody should get.
#
# BEST EFFORT, AND NEVER THE BACKUP'S PROBLEM. No library, no client, no worker:
# this returns 0 and the backup is byte-identical to what it was. The trap
# preserves the script's own exit status explicitly, because an EXIT trap's last
# command would otherwise become it.
