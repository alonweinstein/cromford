# bin/quota-poll.sh — hourly, per box: how much headroom does each registered
# account have left? Writes state/quota/<account>.json; bin/account-pick.sh reads
# it. Runbook: docs/ACCOUNT-ROUTING.md.
#
# INERT UNTIL AN ACCOUNT EXISTS. With no env/accounts.d and no
# state/extra-usage-last.json this writes nothing and exits 0 in under a second,
# which is why the cron line is safe to install fleet-wide ahead of any account.
#
# IT NEVER POLLS THE DEFAULT ACCOUNT. bin/extra-usage-track.sh already polls that
# one at :58 and the usage endpoint's rate limit is PER ACCOUNT — a second poller
# costs the tracker its sample (its header says so, and the five-day 429 in its
# comments is what that looks like). So `default.json` is DERIVED from the raw
# response snapshot the tracker writes, and this script only ever calls the
# endpoint for accounts the tracker knows nothing about.
#
# WHAT CAN BE POLLED AT ALL: a claude account with CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, i.e. a full
# `claude login`, because only a full login's accessToken can read the usage
# endpoint (a setup-token gets 403 user:profile). Every other account form gets a
# status written honestly rather than a number invented for it:
#   claude + CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN -> unreadable   (routing uses cooldowns only)
#   codex                            -> unknown      (no quota source exists)
#   grok / openrouter / fireworks    -> unmetered    (metered API, no plan limit)
#
# NO SECRET REACHES DISK OR A LOG. The token goes to the fetcher through the
# environment, the only strings copied out of the response are reset timestamps
# and numbers, and the fetcher's stderr is classified for a REASON, never stored
# verbatim beyond state/quota/.lasterr-<account> (0600).

# OVERAGE IS A READING, AND IT WAS BEING THROWN AWAY (BH-1456). The endpoint
# reports an `extra_usage` object — is the account billing extra usage, has it

# used to emit only five_hour/seven_day/per_model. So no quota json could say
# "overage is on", and bin/account-pick.sh parked an account at weekly 100% that
# was serving every request perfectly well. It is carried through verbatim,
# renaming only `utilization` to `pct` the way the two windows above are.
# ABSENT IS NOT FALSE: a response with no extra_usage object produces `null`,
# not `{is_enabled:false}` — "we have no reading" and "overage is off" are
