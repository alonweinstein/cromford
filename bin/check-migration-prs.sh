# Migration-PR guard (2026-07-24, after the ActivityItem outage): any MERGED PR
# that ships files under scripts/migrations/ (or *.sql) needs its SQL applied to
# prod BY A HUMAN — this box never applies prod migrations. Alert exactly once
# per PR so merge-order safety stops depending on someone reading the PR body.
#
# THROUGH THE HOOK (2026-08-25). This lane used to beat kind:"migration_check"
# and write its own ALERTS.log line. Both paths went around bin/beat.sh's
# remediation hook, which only ever sees `fleet_alert` — so the one alert class
# whose whole question is "has this SQL been applied yet?", the most mechanically
# answerable question in the harness, was the class no remediator could answer.
# docs/ALERT-REMEDIATION.md named it as the known gap.
#
# It now beats a `fleet_alert` under the `migration` namespace, so it flows
# through tier 1 and tier 2 like every other lane, and its ALERTS.log line moved
# to migrations.log. That second half matters as much as the first:
# poll-commands.sh tails ALERTS.log and re-beats every new line to the console,
# so an ALERTS.log write is a second, unhooked path to the same page — the alert
# would have paged even when the hook settled it. The MESSAGE TEXT of both lines
# is unchanged; only which file and which beat kind carry them.
