# tests/fly-pool-sweep-test.sh — bin/fly-pool.sh's dead-machine sweep (BH-660).
#
# WHAT THIS PINS AND WHY. fly/builder-runner.sh has promised since wave 3 that
# "a stopped pool machine is then destroyed by fly-pool.sh's dead-machine
# sweep". Nothing ever listed the app, so a machine without a tracking file was
# invisible for ever — 18 of them were still sitting in two pools when BH-660
# was filed. The sweep now runs inside the same tick, under the same flock,
# through the same destroy helper the reap uses.
#
# The gate in front of it guards an IRREVERSIBLE call, so the negatives carry
# the weight and come first: a started machine (somebody's build, or a rollout
# smoke run), a machine younger than the TTL, a machine the reap owns this tick,
# a machine whose updated_at cannot be parsed, an empty listing beside tracked
# files, a listing that is not JSON, a listing call that fails, and a project
# with no dedicated pool app (the SPRAWL GUARD — the pool must never run a Fly
# command against a builder-* app). Every one of those must leave the machine
# exactly where it is.
#
# The second half is honesty about failure: flyctl's error body on a refused
# destroy reaches ALERTS.log once per machine per day, the machine is never
# logged as destroyed, and it is retried on the next tick.
#
# Everything runs the REAL bin/fly-pool.sh against a scratch $HARNESS with a
# stubbed flyctl that records every call. Assertions are on artifacts —
# fly-calls.log, fly-pool.log, ALERTS.log, state/fly-pool/tproj/.sweep.json —
# never on the script's source text.
#
# Run from anywhere: tests/fly-pool-sweep-test.sh   (exit 0 = all pass)
