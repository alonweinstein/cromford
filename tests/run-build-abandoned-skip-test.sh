#!/bin/bash
# tests/run-build-abandoned-skip-test.sh — a ticket the blocked-resolver
# ABANDONED is not queued again by a watcher (2026-09-23 pool loop).
#
# BH-1681 was ABANDONED, and a watcher's triage (requested_by
# box-small) re-enqueued it at 19:04 and again at 00:06: queue_put
# turns a failed row back into a queued one, and nothing on the watcher could
# see the hub's ABANDONED record. The `abandoned ticket skip` block of
# bin/run-build.sh reads the fleet ledger row br_abandon now writes (and, for an
# abandon recorded before that, the row's own ABANDONED reason) BEFORE anything
# is queued.
#
# HOW IT DRIVES: the block is lifted out of the pipeline text (tests/lib/rb-all.sh,
# so the answer holds at every state of the BH-478 split) by its markers and
# executed with RESULT, the ledger read and the queue-row read stubbed; each
# case asserts on the RESULT line, the exit code and whether the script went on.
