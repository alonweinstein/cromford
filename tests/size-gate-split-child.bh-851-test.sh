# reads-run-build: raw — the one-copy pin (P1) asserts the driver's own text carries no `split child check` block (it lives once, in bin/lib/rb/plan.sh, since the BH-572 cut); the flatten puts the module's copy back in the driver's place, so only a raw read can see a second copy pasted into the driver.
# tests/size-gate-split-child.bh-851-test.sh — BH-851: the depth-1 guard also
# reads the ticket BODY, and says which way it went.
#
# WHY (2026-09-18). The guard that stops a split child from being split again
# read only `.title` out of $BUILD/ticket-meta.json. A build whose meta file
# never arrived (or whose title had been edited) read as "top-level", so an
# oversized child went back to bin/run-decompose.sh. The filer writes a column-0
# `Split child (depth 1): ...` line into every decompose child's footer
# (fc_child_footer in bin/lib/file-children.sh), so the body on disk is a second
# local source. It is matched strictly: column 0, outside ``` / ~~~ fences, the
# filer's exact text — a ticket that merely QUOTES the line (BH-851 itself does)
# must still split, because a false "child" costs a big PR and a false
# "top-level" costs filed issues.
#
# Every drive runs the REAL size-gate block lifted from the flatten, with the
# decomposer stubbed and gh/curl stubs on PATH that record any call (a child
# must never depend on a network call to avoid being split again). Body
# fixtures come from the real fc_child_footer, not hand-typed.
#
# Run from anywhere. No network, no model call, no secrets.
