# tests/pool-account-test.sh — WHAT A QUOTA READING MEANS, to both pickers.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, SEPARATELY FROM pool-account-routing-test.sh. That suite
# drives the bundle swap: the bytes a machine boots with. This one drives the
# single judgement UNDER it — "does this reading exclude the account" — because
# the two pickers used to answer it separately and drifted apart in the only
# direction that costs money.
#
# The drift, 2026-09-16: bin/quota-poll.sh writes `status: unreadable` for every
# claude account that has no CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR (its header says so — a setup
# token gets 403 on the usage endpoint, so there is nothing honest to write but
# "we cannot read this"). Every pool account is exactly that shape. The hub's
# account_headroom read `unreadable` as "no evidence against" and used the
# account; the pool's _pa_metered read it as "not ok" and dropped it. So the pool
# ranked ZERO accounts, logged `default_saturated` on every spawn, and shipped
# the one capped default token to every machine it launched.
#
# So the cases below are about the READING, not the bytes:
#   1  three accounts whose quota is all `unreadable` -> a lease is taken, on the
#      lowest priority NUMBER, and the bundle carries that account's token; the
#      log never names an `all_unreadable` class, because there is not one
#   2  a cooling account is skipped even when it would otherwise win
#   3  a `status: stale` account, and an `ok` poll that has aged past
#      ACCOUNT_POLL_STALE_SECS, are both skipped — a poller that stopped is a
#      different failure from a poller that answered honestly
#   4  account_headroom and the pool's filter agree on the same file, through one
#      shared classifier — including where they deliberately differ:
#        a  fresh `unreadable`        both usable, empty meter
#        b  fresh `ok` under the caps  both usable, meter survives
#        c  fresh `ok` over a cap      both exclude
#        d  aged `ok`, and no file     hub usable, pool excluded
#        e  AGED `unreadable`          still `unreadable`, still usable to both
#        f  `status: stale` from the poller itself, freshly polled
#   5  the fallback names its class: all_capped, all_stale, all_cooling,
#      all_leased, and `default_saturated` only for a MIXED set — never a bare
#      `default_saturated` for all of them, and never an `all_unreadable`
#
