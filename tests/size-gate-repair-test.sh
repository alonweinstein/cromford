# tests/size-gate-repair-test.sh — a plan that is missing ONLY its `## Size`
# heading builds, with a warning and an estimated size, and buys NO repair
# session.
#
# HISTORY. BH-657 gave the size gate one repair session (the trace gate's
# pattern), because `SIZE_VERDICT: undeclared` went straight to PM_TERMINAL and
# HC-10 died there three times in one hour. BH-5292 (the operator, 2026-10-07) removed
# the terminal for a missing heading: bin/size-gate.sh now estimates the size
# from the plan's file list (`estimated`) and the build proceeds. A model session
# bought to write a number nobody is blocked on is pure spend, so the repair is
# gone too.
# TEST-CHANGE BH-5292: cases A, B, F and G pinned the repair session and the
# terminal after it. They now pin the opposite on the same inputs: no session,
# no terminal, a warning in the log, the estimate on the record. C, D, H are
# unchanged in intent; E (an untraced plan) now continues past the size gate
# because the trace gate owns that refusal.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST. The shipped `# >>> size gate` region (plus the shared
# PLAN_MALFORMED terminal and the enforce switch, each lifted by its own
# markers), driven with the model call, the decomposer, the beat and the ledger
# stubbed. The CC stub records any prompt it is handed: the assertion is that it
# is handed none. Assertions are artifacts: cc.log, $BUILD/size-gate.txt,
# $BUILD/pipeline.log, state/plan-malformed.txt, logs/ALERTS.log and RESULT.
#
# No network, no model call, no secrets. Run from anywhere:
