# tests/ci-plan-test.sh — bin/ci-plan.sh decides WHAT one Harness CI run tests
# and HOW MANY shard jobs it takes (CI cost cut, 2026-09-24).
#
# WHY. MonkCI bills every job, rounded up per job, and the run was a fixed
# 2 x 8-shard matrix whatever the diff selected: a 40-suite PR paid for sixteen
# machines' checkout, node, codegraph, semgrep and apt. And every push to main
# re-ran the whole corpus on a tree the merge queue had just tested. The plan is
# the one place those decisions live, so they are testable here and not in YAML:
#
#   push to main              -> nothing when the queue tested this exact tree
#                                (or main already moved past it); else the
#                                FULL corpus, once — a tree that bypassed the
#                                queue is tested exactly once, here
#   PR from the merge queue   -> the batch diff's impact set (`select
#                                --changed`, mode=batch-selected), or the full
#                                corpus when it escalates (no base, the `full`
#                                label, an escalating path — see
#                                tests/ci-plan-batch-impact.bh-4968-test.sh)
#   PR                        -> bin/test-impact.sh ci-select, as before
#   anything else (schedule,  -> full corpus
#   workflow_dispatch)
#
# and the shard count is ceil(suites / CI_SUITES_PER_SHARD), 1..CI_MAX_SHARDS.
# The failure to fear is a plan that tests NOTHING and reads green, so an empty
# or unreadable selection is rc 2 and never a zero-shard run.
#
# bin/test-impact.sh is replaced by a recording fake through the CI_PLAN_IMPACT
# seam, and the diff through CI_PLAN_CHANGED_FILE, so every branch is driven
# without a git history. P13 drives the REAL test-impact once.
