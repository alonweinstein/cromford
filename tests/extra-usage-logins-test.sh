#!/bin/bash
# tests/extra-usage-logins-test.sh — bin/extra-usage-track.sh polls EVERY login
# a box holds, not one, and says so per ACCOUNT.
#
# THE BUG THIS LOCKS DOWN (2026-09-14). The tracker polled exactly one login:
# the box's own /root/.claude, on the doctrine that the account a box reports is
# the account it bills. That held everywhere except the box that spends the
# most. The hub's lanes authenticate with CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN, which bills
# operator@example.com; its stored login is operator@example.com. So for fifteen days
# the hub faithfully polled a meter belonging to an account that was barely
# spending, while the account paying for every lane on the box ran to $23.8K of
# a $35K monthly cap with nobody reading its meter at all.
#
# DRIVEN, NOT GREPPED. Every claim here is about behaviour, and the script is
# run for real against a local HTTP server that answers per CREDENTIAL — which
# is how one run can hold a working login and a refused one at the same time,
# exactly like the hub does:
#
#   1. a box with no catalog entry and no override polls exactly what it polled
#      before: one login, labelled with the box id, unsuffixed CSV
#   2. catalog/cost-accounts.json drives the list — two logins on one box, two
#      labels, two CSVs, two DB rows, and the box's OWN login keeps the legacy
#      file names every other reader already knows
#   3. EXTRA_USAGE_LOGINS overrides the catalog
#   4. a login that cannot read its meter records status=no-login WITH NO
#      NUMBERS — silence and a $0 meter must never look the same
#   5. the env setup-token is a fallback for the box's OWN login only; using it
#      for a NAMED login would file one account's meter under another's name
#   6. the >=98%-of-cap alert fires once per label and dedupes for 6h
#   7. both kill switches stop it dead
# Run from anywhere: tests/extra-usage-logins-test.sh   (exit 0 = all pass)
