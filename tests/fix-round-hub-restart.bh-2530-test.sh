# tests/fix-round-hub-restart.bh-2530-test.sh — BH-2674 (BH-2530.3): the hub
# enqueues a fix round as a fix_round_jobs row for the owning box and adopts
# the row's result on a later tick. No ssh hop, and nothing the hub holds in
# memory, tmp/ or locks/ describes the round, so it survives a hub restart.
#
# Every tick is the REAL bin/blocked-resolver.sh on the blocked-resolver
# fixture (tests/lib/fixture-harness.sh) with the hub identity set
# (HUB_BOX_NAME=BOX_NAME=hubx; tproj is owned by box-tproj). The jobs worker is
# tests/lib/fake-fix-round-worker.bh-2530.py behind a `curl` shim: the fixture's
# jobs client gains the real transport (bin/lib/jobs/req.sh) and the real
# ledger verbs, and the lane sources the real bin/lib/fix-round-queue.sh. The
# box side of the round (claim, finish) is the same client lib driven here.
#
# Cases:
#   1-6  the restart walk: queue, restart, in flight, box finishes, adopt once
#   D1   a duplicate enqueue answer is logged as in flight, no second row
#   N1   a done row for ANOTHER cap key of the project is not adopted
#   N2   an adopted row is never re-acted
#   N3   a claimed row, hours stale, runs no rung and no second enqueue, and
#        pages ONCE as a stale claim (review F1: a dead box's claim is never
#        re-offered to another box, so without the page it waits forever)
#   N3b  a live claim, and a claim whose stamp does not parse, page nothing
#   L1   the queue lib missing on the hub pages once, keyed per project
#   N4   a done row whose record is another project's: hub record byte-identical
#   N5   a box-paused result is adopted with nothing spent, paged or closed
#   N6   the worker down at the gate: return 3, no enqueue, no rung
#   N7   the worker reads but refuses the write: NOT queued, nothing spent
#   A1   the adopt is not recorded (outage): no rung; the next tick takes it once
#   A2   the adopt answers 409 (another tick won it): no rung
#   C1   BR_FIX_SLOTS counts the remote open rows; the worker down fails open
#   U1   a row nobody claims past BR_FIX_LANE_TIMEOUT pages, keyed per park
