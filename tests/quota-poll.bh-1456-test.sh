# tests/quota-poll.bh-1456-test.sh — WHAT THE DERIVED QUOTA JSON CARRIES, AND
# WHOSE METER IT IS.
#
# Two defects, one masking the other (BH-1456):
#
#   1  bin/quota-poll.sh's normalize() emitted five_hour/seven_day/per_model and
#      nothing else, so the endpoint's `extra_usage` object — the one that says
#      "overage billing is ON for this account" — was dropped on the floor. No
#      quota json could say it, so bin/account-pick.sh classed an account at
#      weekly 100% as `capped` while it was serving perfectly well in overage.
#
#   2  the implicit `default` account's json is DERIVED from
#      state/extra-usage-last.json, which is the BOX LOGIN's meter. On the hub
#      that login is operator@example.com, but the `default` credential
#      (CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN in env/global.env) bills operator@example.com,
#      whose snapshot is state/extra-usage-last-project-6-account.json. So the
#      `default` row showed a 4% week while the token it describes was at 100%.
#
# The cases:
#   1  a snapshot carrying `extra_usage` -> default.json.extra_usage is the full
#      object; a POLLED account whose response has none -> `null`, not `false`
#      (absent is not a reading — D11)
#   2  ACCOUNT_DEFAULT_LABEL set + the labelled snapshot present -> the numbers
#      come from the LABELLED file and `source` names the label
#   3  the label set and its file MISSING -> today's plain derivation plus
#      exactly ONE `default fallback label_snapshot_missing:<label>` log row
#   4  the label UNSET -> plain derivation, and NO fallback row at all (every
#      box that never sets the knob must be byte-identical to before)
#
# Run from anywhere: tests/quota-poll.bh-1456-test.sh   (exit 0 = all pass)
