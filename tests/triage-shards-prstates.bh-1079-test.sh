# tests/triage-shards-prstates.bh-1079-test.sh — BH-1079: the two spend defects
# the round-2 review of BH-1015 found, plus the four nits around them.
#
# WHAT WENT WRONG, both of them in the lane that was supposed to STOP spending:
#
#   A — A SKIP-ONLY TICK NEVER CONSUMED THE BOARD FINGERPRINT.
#   bin/lib/rt/shards.sh absorbed state/<p>.gate.pending into state/<p>.gate.json
#   only when it had actually DISPATCHED something (`[ "$SHARD_N" -gt 0 ]`). A key
#   that the held path had re-armed out of gate.json therefore stayed out of it for
#   ever: every following tick re-fetched the board, bin/gate-diff.sh reported it
#   `NEW <id>` again, the per-ticket fingerprint correctly said "unchanged, no
#   session", and the tick paid for the board round-trip again — until the 4h
#   fingerprint TTL expired and bought one spurious session. The gate could never
#   answer `SKIP no-change`, because the file it compares against was missing the
#   very ticket the board keeps reporting.
#
#   B — AN OLDER PR STATE OVERWROTE A NEWER ONE.
#   triage_prstates_ingest folds line 3 of state/<p>.queuefp (the gate's own
#   45-minute PR lookup) into the ledger, and it stamped every pair with `now`
#   while _tsh_prstates_put overwrote unconditionally. queuefp line 3 SURVIVES
#   ticks the gate did not re-read on, so a vector written ten minutes ago was
#   re-ingested as if it had just been read — and a `12=OPEN` from then replaced a
#   `12 MERGED` the REST refresh had just established. Every key naming PR #12 then
#   flipped its fingerprint and bought a session, on a merge that had already
#   happened.
#
# The four nits are the same lane's economics: MERGED/CLOSED are terminal and must
# never be re-bought, a failed REST lookup must not be silent, both PR lookups
# (the ledger's and the gate's own) must consult bin/lib/gh-budget.sh before they
# spend, and the ledger must be pruned so it cannot grow for ever.
#
# WHAT IS AT STAKE IN EACH CASE. "0 calls" alone would pass a lane that had simply
# stopped working, so every skip case is paired with one that MUST still act: a
# thread that really moved (A3), a gate vector that really is newer (B2), an OPEN
# entry aged past the TTL (C2), a healthy budget (E2/F2), a named old entry (G1).
#
# Parts A, B3, F and G2 drive the REAL bin/run-triage.sh / bin/triage-gate.sh /
# bin/gate-diff.sh against a scratch $HARNESS; only the harness and repo ROOTS are
# rewritten (the precedent tests/triage-shards-ticket-fp-test.sh set). The stub
# agent-call writes a cost row, so "no session was bought" is asserted on
# logs/cost.csv and not only on a log line; the stub `gh` records every call, so
# "no lookup happened" is an assertion on fixture/gh-calls.
