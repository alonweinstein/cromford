#!/bin/bash
# tests/gh-rest-no-subshell-lint.sh — no caller may wrap a bin/lib/gh-rest.sh
# helper in a command substitution.
#
# THE RULE. `bin/lib/gh-rest.sh`'s own header states it: "when you need the
# status after a helper, run the helper as a plain command with `> file` and
# read the file; a helper inside `$( )` still returns the right rc, but its
# status stays in the subshell that then died." GH_REST_STATUS and
# GH_REST_REASON are assigned in the shell that CALLS the helper, and a command
# substitution is a subshell: the rc survives, the two variables do not.
#
# WHAT THAT COSTS. BH-781: "every alert said HTTP 000 for a 403 the library had
# classified correctly". BH-1485 measured it still true on 21 live call sites —
# among them `bin/lib/mc/rebase.sh`'s stack-parent read, which logged
# `HTTP 000` through an hour of a measurably exhausted hourly quota, so the
# rate limit and a dead network read identically in the log and in ALERTS.log
# and the diagnosis needed a manual `rate_limit` call from the box.
#
# WHAT IS FLAGGED: a `$(`, `$( ` or backtick immediately followed by one of the
# ENUMERATED status-bearing helper names — `gh_rest`, `gh_rest_pr_state`,
# `gh_rest_pr_list`, `gh_rest_pr_list_all`, `gh_rest_issue_state`,
# `gh_rest_issue_list`, `gh_rest_issue_comments`, `gh_rest_comment`,
# `gh_rest_close`, `gh_rest_alert`, and BH-1485's `gh_rest_*_var` variants
# (which are flagged too: a variant that exists to keep the status alive is
# pointless inside a subshell). Enumerated, not a `gh_rest*` prefix wildcard
# (BH-1485 fix round) — see the list's own comment in scan.py for why.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT FLAGGED:
#   - comments. A sentence about `$(gh_rest GET …)` loses no status, and
#     bin/lib/mc/classify.sh's header quotes the bug it fixed verbatim.
#   - heredoc bodies, ONLY when the opener is real code, not text inside a
#     quoted string a script is writing out (BH-1485 fix round, review I1).
#     Several scripts WRITE shell into a fixture or a remote script; the text
#     in a real heredoc, or inside a string that merely LOOKS like one, is
#     data to this file either way.
#     The terminator word is matched WHOLE (BH-1522): a heredoc body is only
#     skipped up to the word the opener actually named, so an opener like
#     `<<PRE || true` cannot be misread as opening `PR` and swallow the rest
#     of the file. Row 5 asserts repo-wide that no file's scan ends still
#     inside a heredoc body, which is what that misreading looks like.
#   - `_gh_rest_*` privates. They are internal to the library, which obeys its
#     own rule, and `$(_gh_rest_stfile)` (bin/lib/mc/classify.sh) prints a PATH
#     and performs no read — a rule that dragged it in would be wrong about it.
#   - a `gh_rest_*`-NAMED helper that is not one of the enumerated callers —
#     `gh_rest_path_class` (bin/lib/gh-rest-ledger.sh) classifies a path
#     string and never touches GH_REST_STATUS/GH_REST_REASON; capturing it
#     loses nothing.
#
# A SCAN THAT SCANNED NOTHING IS NOT A PASS (D9): a tree with no `bin/**/*.sh`
# in it exits 2, never 0.
#
# The scanner is written out as a standalone program and the SAME program scans
# the repo and the fixtures below — a lint nobody has watched fail is a lint
# nobody knows is wired up. It prints `path:line`, never the line's contents: a
# flagged line can carry a token in its arguments.

# A heredoc opener: `<<WORD`, `<<-WORD`, `<<'WORD'`, `<<"WORD"`. The body is
# data, not code this file gets to have an opinion about.
#
# BH-1485 fix round (review I1), three false-heredoc traps closed:
#   - `(?<!<)` in front: a here-string `<<<word` is two `<<` immediately
#     followed by a third `<`, which used to match the SAME as a real opener
#     and swallow the rest of the file as a phony "heredoc body" nothing ever
#     terminates. The lookbehind rejects the match that starts on the second
#     `<` of the triple, and the match starting on the first `<` then fails
#     for a different reason: the next character is `<`, not `[A-Za-z_]`.
#   - `(?!\s*[)&|;])` after the word: `$(( a << b ))` is an arithmetic left
#     shift, not a heredoc, and `b` looks like a valid terminator word to the
#     old pattern — the body then never closes (no line is ever bare `b`) and
#     every call after it in the file goes unscanned. Right after a genuine
#     heredoc terminator the line ends, or is followed by another redirection
#     or a command separator; right after an arithmetic shift's RHS it is
#     `))`, `)`, `&&`, `||` or `;` from the enclosing expression — reject the
#     match when a `)`/`&`/`|`/`;` (with optional space) follows immediately.
#   - only OUTSIDE quotes: `bin/remote-gate.sh` does
#     `echo "cat > \"\$R/suites\" <<'RG_SUITES'"` — text this file WRITES into
#     a remote script, not a heredoc THIS file opens. quote_span reuses
#     strip_comment's own quote-tracking so a match that starts inside a
#     quoted string is skipped, the same way a `#` inside quotes is not a
#     comment.
#   - `(?![A-Za-z0-9_])` right after the word group, and the trailing
#     lookahead narrowed to `\)` alone (BH-1522 N1). The word group had no
#     right anchor, so when `(?!\s*[)&|;])` rejected a real opener whose
#     terminator is followed by an operator the engine simply BACKTRACKED to a
#     shorter word and matched anyway: `read -r -d '' PREAMBLE <<PRE || true`
#     (bin/box-chat.sh:115) matched with word `PR`, no line is ever bare `PR`,
#     and lines 116-252 of that file were treated as heredoc body — every
#     gh_rest call there went unscanned and the lint read clean. Anchoring the
#     word forces it to be consumed whole; with that in place the `&|;` arm of
#     the lookahead can only ever cause this bug (a real `<<WORD || …`,
#     `<<WORD && …`, `<<WORD; …` opener would be read as no heredoc at all and
#     its body scanned as code), so only `\)` — the arithmetic-shift trap
#     `$(( a << b ))`, still rejected — is left. `$(( a << b && c ))` would now
#     be misread; it occurs nowhere under bin/, and row 5's unterminated-span
#     self-check catches it repo-wide the day it appears.
