# a stubbed harness-jobs API.
#
# THE GAP THIS CLOSES (2026-09-14, cost fix 4). We have two independent
# measurements of the same money: Anthropic's own extra-usage meter (the
# invoice) and cost_rows (our per-call ledger, which every dashboard, PR cost
# and budget in this harness is built on). Nothing had ever compared them, so
# when the project-6 account ran to $23.8K of a $35K cap the ledger said nothing
# was wrong — a ledger cannot see an invoice, and an invoice cannot see a lane.
#
# The product is one row per (account, window) and ONE alert per day when a
# metered account's two numbers disagree by more than RECONCILE_GAP_PCT. Almost
# everything asserted below is about NOT alerting: an alarm that rings on a
# quiet week is one nobody reads on the week that matters.
#
#   1. metered: meter delta vs summed rows, gap $ and %, alert over the
#      threshold, ONE per account per day (dedupe), none under it
#   2. credits-covered: under the weekly cap the meter reads $0 and is RIGHT to.
#      $0 against $600 of rows is the plan working, not a 100% discrepancy
#   3. no-login / no-meter / meter-reset: three different nothings, each named
#   4. the sum itself: non-Anthropic runners excluded, unlabelled rows reported
#      as unattributed rather than summed, pool jobs counted ONLY for machines
#      that push no rows of their own, pagination walked to the end
#   5. the floors: a tiny meter movement and a too-short meter span do not alert
#   6. the window forms, the DB push, --dry-run, and both kill switches
# Run from anywhere: tests/cost-reconcile-test.sh   (exit 0 = all pass)
