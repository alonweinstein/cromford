# tests/orphan-reconcile-refused-test.sh — bin/orphan-reconcile.sh never
# launches a ticket bin/run-build.sh is going to refuse.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-09-26/27). The reconciler re-launched the same nine
# project-5 tickets on EVERY tick (TK-1174, 1795, 1805, 2040, 2091, 2325, 2326,
# 2492, 2510). run-build refused each one — SKIP_ABANDONED (the fleet ledger's
# `abandoned` row) or HELD `hold:title` — so nothing was built, but every
# refusal left a new builds/<p>-<KEY>-*/RESULT behind, and that RESULT list is
# an input of bin/triage-gate.sh's queue fingerprint. A fingerprint that moves
# every tick defeats the queue-unchanged brake, and the tick bought a paid Opus
# triage session instead: about $830 in ~26h.
#
# Three gaps, each driven here against the real script:
#   1. ABANDONED / SUPERSEDED. run-build reads `ledger abandoned "<p> <KEY>"` and
#      the queue row's ABANDONED reason; the reconciler read neither.
#   2. THE HOLD READING. The reconciler judged holds with its own copy of the
#      regexes and no bot filter, so run-build's own BUILD_DEFERRED close-out
#      ("…; RESUME on the ticket lifts it", posted by the App) read as a LIFT of
#      a title HOLD. bin/lib/hold.sh's hold_classify skips bot comments.
#   3. THE RESHAPE DROPPED LABELS, so a `hold` label (BH-2504) was invisible.
# And the property that cost the money: the queue fingerprint, computed by the
# real QFP line lifted out of bin/triage-gate.sh, is identical across two ticks
# that see the same refused tickets.
#
# gh and curl are PATH shims (no network, no secrets). run-build.sh is a shim
# that records its argv AND leaves what the real one leaves on a refusal: a
# fresh build dir with a BUILD_REFUSED RESULT (already swept, COMMENTED).

# ---------- 8. parity with run-build, not wider (review of #3061) -----------
# run-build refuses a queue row ONLY as `failed|ABANDONED by the blocked-resolver`
# (bin/lib/rb/gates.sh). The resolver's "the ticket says ABANDON" row carries no
# ledger row and tells the human to comment RESUME; after the RESUME hold.sh
# reads the ticket clear and run-build builds it, so the reconciler must launch
# it — skipping on the stale row reason would park it forever. An ABANDON that
# was NOT lifted is refused by hold.sh (the ticket), not by the row. An
# operator's pool abandon (fly-pool.sh, BH-2406) is not a run-build refusal
# either, so it launches as run-build would build it.
