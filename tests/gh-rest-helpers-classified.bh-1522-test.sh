# tests/gh-rest-helpers-classified.bh-1522-test.sh — BH-1522 (N2): every
# gh_rest_* helper defined in bin/lib/gh-rest*.sh is CLASSIFIED, one way or the
# other.
#
# WHY. tests/gh-rest-no-subshell-lint.sh flags an ENUMERATED list of
# status-bearing helpers (its HELPERS tuple), deliberately not a `gh_rest*`
# wildcard — BH-1485's fix round explains why. The cost of enumerating is that
# a genuinely new status-bearing helper is OUTSIDE the lint the day it is
# defined and nothing says so. This suite closes that: a defined helper is
# either in HELPERS (caller-visible status, so the lint guards it) or in the
# PURE_ALLOW list below with a reason (no REST call, never sets
# GH_REST_STATUS/GH_REST_REASON, so capturing it loses nothing). In neither, or
# in both, is a FAIL that names the helper and the two places to fix.
#
# The HELPERS tuple is read from the scanner itself (`scan.py --helpers`),
# extracted from the lint the same way the lint writes it out — no
# regex-parsing of Python source.
#
