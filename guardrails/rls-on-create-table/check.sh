# Every migration that CREATEs a table must ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY on it.
# Supabase auto-grants anon/authenticated full CRUD on every new public table
# and exposes it through PostgREST, so an RLS-off table means anyone holding the
# project URL and the anon key can read, write, and delete it — app auth
# bypassed entirely. Our apps connect as postgres/service-role (both BYPASSRLS),
# so deny-all RLS is a ZERO-app-impact change; there is no cost to being right.
#
# Deliberately NOT a semgrep rule: the condition is "this file creates a table
# AND does not, anywhere in the same file, enable RLS on it" — a whole-file
# absence assertion, which pattern matchers express badly and which reviewers
# then misread. A twenty-line shell check that says exactly what it means is the
# honest tool here.
#
# Default target: prisma/migrations and supabase/migrations, if they exist.
# rc 0 = clean (or skipped via the escape hatch), rc 1 = violation.

Add to each such migration, for every table it creates:
    ALTER TABLE public."<Table>" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
Deny-all RLS (enabled, no policies) is correct for tables our apps reach as
postgres/service-role. A worker role that is NOT postgres/service_role and
lacks BYPASSRLS needs a scoped policy created BEFORE the ALTER, or it locks
itself out. Full recipe: ~/.claude/rules/supabase-rls.md
