# A file that is RENDERED from fragments is edited through its fragments, never
# by hand. A hand edit survives until the next render and then vanishes without
# a trace — the repo has two spellings of the same thing and the one in the diff
# is the one that loses. So a PR that changes a rendered registry file and none
# of that file's inputs fails here, with the fragment dir and the render command
# in the message.
#
# The rendered paths, their inputs and their render commands are ONE spelling,
# owned by bin/lib/render-fragments.sh's rf_registry(). The default map below is
# that list, and tests/guardrails-test.sh extracts it by its markers and diffs it
# against rf_registry so the two cannot drift.
#
# Configuration (env, so a repo tunes it without forking the script):
#   RFF_MAP       rows '<rendered glob>|<input paths>|<renderer command>',
#                 newline separated. Blank lines and # comments are skipped.
#   RFF_MAP_FILE  a file of the same rows — a target repo's own registry. It
#                 wins over RFF_MAP, which wins over the baked default.
#   RFF_FILES     a file holding the changed-file list, one path per line. Set
#                 it and no git call is made — that is how the check is testable
#                 on fixtures, and how a CI that already has the list avoids a
#                 second diff.
#   RFF_ROOT      the checkout adoption is judged in (default '.').
#
# rc 0 = fresh / not adopted / no rendered file / not checked. rc 1 = a rendered
# file changed without its inputs.

A hand edit to a rendered file is reverted by the next render, silently, and
until then the repo holds two spellings of the same thing. Change the fragment,
re-render, and commit both in this PR.

If this genuinely needs no fragment change, take the escape hatch: add the
'skip-guardrail' label AND say why in GUARDRAIL_JUSTIFICATION. The reason stays
in the PR record.
