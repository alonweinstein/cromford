#
# Colocation-as-CI. A PR that changes what the app DOES must change the map that
# says how to reach and drive it, in the same diff — "without enforcement, the
# principle decays in months". This is the mechanical half of the verification
# map (Wave B): the map lives in the target repo at docs/verification-map/, the
# PR that changes a route updates it, and this check is what makes that true
# rather than aspirational.
#
# Built generically NOW, ahead of the map itself, so Wave B has a working
# freshness gate on day one instead of a TODO. On a repo with no
# docs/verification-map/ yet it reports "not adopted" and exits 0 — a check that
# failed every PR in every unmigrated repo would be turned off before the map
# ever landed.
#
# Configuration (env, so a repo tunes it without forking the script):
#   VMAP_ROUTE_GLOBS  space-separated shell globs for "this changes behavior"
#                     (default: src/app/* app/* pages/* src/pages/*)
#   VMAP_MAP_PREFIX   path prefix the map lives under
#                     (default: docs/verification-map/)
#   VMAP_FILES        a file containing the changed-file list, one per line.
#                     Set this and no git call is made — that is how the check
#                     is testable on fixtures, and how a CI that already has the
#                     list avoids a second diff.
#
# rc 0 = fresh / not adopted / skipped. rc 1 = routes changed, map did not.

Update the map entry for the feature you changed — what it is, its nav path, key
routes, selectors, preconditions — in this same PR. A map that lags the app is
worse than no map: agents and QA sessions drive it as if it were true.

If this genuinely needs no map change (a pure refactor, a typo), take the
escape hatch: add the 'skip-guardrail' label AND say why in
GUARDRAIL_JUSTIFICATION. The reason stays in the PR record.
