# Lookback clustering (BH-1795.2)

You are reviewing one week of repeat failures from the build harness. Each item
below is one failure: a reopened ticket, a blocked review, a repeated alert, a
rebuilt PR. Your job is to group the items by ONE shared cause, so that each
group can become one issue that fixes that cause.

## Key kinds

Every group is keyed by exactly one thing that EVERY item in it shares:

- `file`: a path that appears in every item's `files[]`. `key_value` is the
  exact path, character for character.
- `lane`: every item has the same `lane`. `key_value` is that lane name.
- `reason`: every item's `reason` says the same thing once numbers, shas and
  URLs are removed. `key_value` is that shared wording.

A group whose key is not true of every item in it is thrown away by a
mechanical check, so do not stretch a key to fit. An item belongs to at most
one group. A group needs at least two items. Leave an item out rather than
force it into a group.

The candidate groups below were built mechanically from the same three keys.
They are hints: use them, split them or ignore them, but never invent an id.

## Target

- `harness`: the cause is in the build harness itself (its scripts, lanes,
  catalog or worker). Use `project: "cromford"`.
- `app`: the cause is in one product repo. Every item must be from that one
  project, and `project` is its name (never `cromford`).
- When you are not sure, use `harness`.

## Answer contract

Answer ONLY a JSON array `[{key_kind, key_value, item_ids[], target, project, title, cause, proposed_fix}]`,
no prose, no code fence, `[]` when nothing clusters.

## Voice for title, cause and proposed_fix

These three fields become the title and body of a filed issue, read by the
team. Write them like this:

- Plain first person plural ("we reopen", "our rebase lane"), short sentences.
- No em dashes.
- Never "It's not X, it's Y".
- Numbers over adjectives: "4 reopens in 6 days", not "frequent reopens".
- `title` is one line under 80 characters. `cause` says what goes wrong and
  why. `proposed_fix` says what we change, where.
