-- The hotfix tier (the operator, 2026-10-07): a ticket labelled `hotfix` is sized against
-- size_gate.<axis>.hotfix.<project> then size_gate.<axis>.hotfix before the rows
-- above, so an emergency builds as one PR instead of being split. Its own
-- statement (BH-1000), INSERT OR IGNORE so an edit on /config survives re-apply.
-- No row (an unapplied schema) means the hotfix falls back to the 700/20 chain.
